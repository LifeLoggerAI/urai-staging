# UrAi Cross-System Canon Authority

Status: ADOPTION CANDIDATE — becomes binding cross-system authority only after the upstream Labs canon PR is legitimately merged.

Repository role: **non-production staging and TEST-only provider bridge**

## Upstream authority

Cross-system canon candidate:
- Repository: `LifeLoggerAI/urai-labs-llc`
- PR: `#102`
- Canon path: `docs/canon/`

Until that PR is merged, this repository's current merged runtime/release contracts remain authoritative for implementation facts. This adoption file does not transfer certification, review, deployment, provider or exact-head evidence between repositories.

## Local invariants

- Staging must fail closed and must not alias canonical production.
- Production identifiers may appear only as prohibited/reference values in safety checks.
- TEST-only provider state cannot be substituted with LIVE evidence.

## Conflict resolution

Use this order:
1. verified live runtime for runtime facts;
2. merged production source for implementation facts;
3. exact-head release/deployment evidence;
4. local canonical contracts/schemas;
5. merged cross-system UrAi Canon Bible;
6. roadmaps/planning/history.

If runtime conflicts with product canon because runtime is defective, record a defect; do not silently redefine canon.

## Evidence integrity

- exact-head evidence never transfers after a head move;
- queued/pending/skipped/cancelled/stale is not success;
- predecessor approval does not approve a successor SHA;
- provider LIVE state is never inferred from source configuration;
- green CI alone is not Gold Master;
- future source code may exist only under the repo's approved hard-off/fail-closed boundary.

## Required adoption action

After upstream PR #102 merges, reconcile this repository's local docs/contracts against the merged canon and classify every conflict as RESOLVED, DEFERRED with an external blocker, or SUPERSEDED with preserved historical provenance.
